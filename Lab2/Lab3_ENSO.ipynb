    "# Lab 3: The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a coupled ocean‐atmosphere climate phenomenon with global impacts on temperature, sea level pressure, and precipitation patterns (Bjerknes, 1969; Ropelewski & Halpert, 1987). This lab explores observed ENSO variability from 1950-Present. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please carefully read the dataset descriptions prior to starting the lab and use comments (`#`) throughout to organize your code and make it more readable. **This lab is worth 60 points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lab you will learn and practice the following skills:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpreting global atmospheric and sea surface temperature patterns associated with ENSO\n",
    "- Geospatial analysis \n",
    "- Statistical analysis\n",
    "- Manipulating gridded data with Xarray\n",
    "- Data visualization with Cartopy, Matplotlib, and cmocean\n",
    "\n",
    "### To submit via Canvas:\n",
    "\n",
    "To foster a collaborative learning environment, you are encouraged to work in groups of 2-3, but each person must write and submit their own code (and comments), and individually answer all interpretation questions. All students must complete all problems - it is against the honor code to divide the problems up among different individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior to submitting your lab assignments on Canvas, please name your Notebook files using the following syntax: *LastName_FirstName_EV333_Lab3.ipynb.*\n",
    "- Type you responses to the short-answer questions in this Notebook. Add a cell and select 'Markdown' instead of 'Code' from the drop down menu. Add **Answer:** and provide your written responses.\n",
    "- Re-run all cells to ensure that the Notebook runs completely through without errors and that all figures are displayed.\n",

    "### Niño3.4 Monthly SST Anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "Sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) averaged across the Niño 3.4 region (5°N-5°S, 120°-170°W) in the central equatorial Pacific are used to define El Niño (warm phase) and La Niña (cool phase) events. Monthly SST anomalies from January 1950- February 2024 are provided in `detrend.nino34.monthly.txt`. The anomalies are based on centered 30-year reference periods updated every 5 years (i.e., sliding climatologies). This approach detrends the data, removing the long-term observed warming signal. Data downloaded from [NOAA/CPC](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/detrend.nino34.ascii.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ERA5 Reanalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The data was accessed from the [ECMWF Climate Data Portal](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The full reanalysis product covers the period from January 1940 to present. The original monthly datasets were regridded to a much coarser  ~4 $^\\circ$ latitude x 4$^\\circ$ longitude horizontal resolution (16.7 MB per file). The 4$^\\circ$ resolution will still show the broad global patterns. You will work with sea surface temperature (SST) and mean sea level pressure (SLP) data in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sea surface temperature (K):** This parameter (SST) is the temperature of sea water near the surface. In ERA5, this parameter is a foundation SST, which means there are no variations due to the daily cycle of the sun (diurnal variations). SST, in ERA5, is given by two external providers. Before September 2007, SST from the HadISST2 dataset is used and from September 2007 onwards, the OSTIA dataset is used. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius by subtracting 273.15.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean sea level pressure (Pa):** This parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere at the surface of the Earth, adjusted to the height of mean sea level. It is a measure of the weight that all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface would have, if the point were located at mean sea level. It is calculated over all surfaces - land, sea and inland water. Maps of mean sea level pressure are used to identify the locations of low and high pressure. Contours of mean sea level pressure also indicate the strength of the wind. Tightly packed contours show stronger winds. The units of this parameter are pascals (Pa). Mean sea level pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa)."
