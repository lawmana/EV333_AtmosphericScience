    "# Lab 2: Large-scale atmospheric circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab explores general atmospheric circulation patterns using the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The reanalysis combines model data with observations from around the world to provide hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land, and oceanic climate variables. The data was accessed from the [ECMWF Climate Data Portal](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The full reanalysis product covers the period from January 1940 to present. The original monthly datasets are available at 0.25$^\\circ$ latitude x 0.25$^\\circ$ longitude horizontal resolution. This yields 4.2 GB of data *per atmospheric variable*, so the files were regridded to a much coarser  ~4 $^\\circ$ latitude x 4$^\\circ$ longitude horizontal resolution (16.7 MB per file). The 4$^\\circ$ resolution will still show the broad global patterns. However, if you would like to work with the higher-resolution files please ask Dr. Lawman and she will share them with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will analyze global monthly and seasonal variations in 2-meter (near-surface) temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. You will then calculate anomalies and explore the spatial patterns of rising global temperatures.  All code and figures will be generated in this Jupyter Notebook using in Python. Please use comments (`#`) to organize your code and make it more readable.  **This lab is worth 60 points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required data:** (Download from GitHub)\n",
    "- **2 m temperature:** ERA5_monthly_t2m_regrid.nc \n",
    "- **Total precipitation:** ERA5_monthly_tp_regrid.nc\n",
    "- **10 m wind speed:** ERA5_monthly_si10_regrid.nc\n",

    "- **10 m v-component of wind (meridional wind):** ERA5_monthly_v10_regrid.nc\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lab you will learn and practice the following skills:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpreting global atmospheric patterns\n",
    "- Geospatial analysis \n",
    "- Statistical analysis\n",
    "- Manipulating gridded data with Xarray\n",
    "- Data visualization with Cartopy and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before you begin:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to install an additional Python library called NetCDF4. The steps are outlined below: \n",
    "1. Open a new terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows)\n",
    "2. Activate your Atmo_EV333 environment: `conda activate Atmo_EV333`\n",
    "3. Install NetCDF4 by typing in the command line: `pip install netCDF4`\n",
    "4. Now you are ready to proceed with the rest of the lab\n",
    "\n",
    "**To submit via Canvas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To foster a collaborative learning environment, you are encouraged to work in groups of 2-3, but each person must write and submit their own code, and individually answer all interpretation questions. All students must complete all problems - it is against the honor code to divide the problems up among different individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior to submitting your lab assignments on Canvas, please name your Notebook files using the following syntax: *LastName_FirstName_EV333_Lab2.ipynb.*\n",
    "- Type you responses to the short-answer questions in this Notebook. Add a cell and select 'Markdown' instead of 'Code' from the drop down menu. Add **Answer:** and provide your written responses.\n",
    "- Re-run all cells to ensure that the Notebook runs completely through without errors and that all figures are displayed.\n",
    "- Upload your final Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) to Canvas\n",

    "\n",
    "**2m temperature (K)**: This parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total precipitation (m)**: This parameter is the accumulated liquid and frozen water, comprising rain and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale precipitation and convective precipitation. Large-scale precipitation is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Convective precipitation is generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. This parameter does not include fog, dew or the precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before it lands at the surface of the Earth. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis, the accumulation period is 1 day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10m u-component of wind (m/s):** This parameter is the eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**10m v-component of wind (m/s)**: This parameter is the northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).\n",

    "**10m wind speed (m/s):** This parameter is the horizontal speed of the wind, or movement of air, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth.

The eastward and northward components of the horizontal wind at 10m are also available as parameters (descriptions above).\n",

NetCDF data is a file format for storing multidimensional scientific data.

    "## Part 4: Generate global seasonal mean precipitation maps (for 1940-2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "How does precipitation vary throughout the year? To find this out, let's make maps of seasonal mean precipitation. Seasonal averages are for December-January-February (DJF), March-April-May (MAM), June-July-August (JJA), and September-October-November (SON).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a seasonal mean, use the `groupby.()` method you used in Lab 1, but instead here on DataSets and DataArrays instead of Pandas DataFrames. Here you will group the data by season: `ds.groupby(ds['time'].dt.season)` and calculate the mean using the `.mean()` method. For example: `ds_seas = ds.groupby(ds['time'].dt.season).mean()` where `ds_seas` is a variable for the seasonal averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ds_seas[0]` will be the DJF average, `ds_seas[1]` will be the JJA average. You may want to define variables to help keep the seasonal means organized. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# define seasonal means by subsetting ds_seas\n",
    "DJF = ds_seas[0]\n",
    "JJA = ds_seas[1]\n",
    "MAM = ...add your code...\n",
    "SON = ...add your code...\n",

    "In the last section of this lab, you will create 2 m air temperature anomaly maps showing the difference (i.e., temperature anomalies) between two 20-year intervals. Here you will plot the difference between (2003-2022) and (1961-1980). To select a temporal subset, use the `time=slice() method`. An example is provided below:\n",

    "5. Generate a difference map. The [cmocean Balance](https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) colormap is recommended. Blue colors will indicate cool anomalies and red colors will indicate warm anomalies. \n",
