    "# Lab 0: Colorado Springs Weather & Climate Data Analysis & Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab explores weather data from April 1948 through December 2022 collected at the Colorado Springs Municipal Airport (station 051778, 38.80949$^\\circ$N, 104.6887$^\\circ$W). Weather data from this station, at an elevation of 6,182 ft, is one of the longest observational records in the area. The data was accessed from the [Colorado Climate Center](https://climate.colostate.edu/data_access_new.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "First you will analyze monthly and seasonal variations in minimum and maximum temperature, prcipitation, and snowfall. Then you will  calculate annual averages and explore long-term trends. All code and figures will be generated in this Jupyter Notebook using the Python programming language. Use comments (the `#` symbol) to organize your code and make it more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to code requires patience and practice! This notebook includes detailed instructions and sample code to help guide you through the process. Please systematically walk through the sample code and make sure you understand each line before proceeding.\n",

    "**To submit via Canvas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To foster a collaborative learning environment, you are encouraged to work with a partner, but each person must write and submit their own code, and answer all interpretation and synthesis questions in their own words. All students must complete all problems - it is against the honor code to divide the problems up among different individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior to submitting your lab, please name your Notebook file using the following syntax: *LastName_FirstName_EV333_Lab0.ipynb.*\n",
    "- Please run the notebook from the beginning to check it generates all figures and runs without any errors. Then upload your notebook to Canvas.\n",

    "**Learning outcomes:** \n",
    "In this lab you will learn and practice the following skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpreting local atmospheric observations\n",
    "- Calculating the climatology for Colorado Springs\n",
    "- Time series analysis\n",
    "- Statistical analysis\n",
    "- Manipulating data in Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "- Data visualization with Matplotlib\n",
    "- Describing the factors that influence weather and climate in Colorado Spring \n",

    "## Pre-process the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells below import the necessary Python packages and load `CO_Springs_Airport_Monthly.csv` as a Pandas **DataFrame** called `df`. The DataFrame contains monthly averages of minimim and maximum temperature (in $^\\circ$F), precipitation (in inches), and snowfall (in inches) from 1948-2022. Each column of data is a Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to practice manipulating and plotting the data, so the pre-processing steps are completed for you. Carefully go through each line of code to make sure you understand it. The processed `df` DataFrame is displayed. "

    "Which month *on average* has the highest maximum temperatures? Which month has the most rain? What about the most snow? Can you easily answer this based on the time series plots? The answer is *probably not*. There is over 70 years of data and there are year-to-year fluctuations. It's hard to tell based on the time axis. Instead, we can calculate the average January value, the average February value, the average March value, ..., etc. The average month-to-month changes throughout the year is the average seasonal cycle, or the climatology.\n",

This will be accomplished using the [groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) operation that involves splitting the object, applying a function, and combining the results. This is useful for grouping large amounts of data and computing operations on these groups. \n",

    "To answer the following questions, please consult your Lab 0 figures and draw upon your knowledge of the week 1 course material. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [2pts] Colorado’s climate is governed by five major factors. Describe at least 3 of these factors and how they influence the local climate of Colorado Springs.\n",
    "2. [2pts] How would the seasons in Colorado Springs be affected if the tilt of the Earth’s axis increased from 23.5° to 40°? Qualitatively, how would this change the climatology plots you generated in this lab?\n",
    "3. [2pts] Why does the surface temperature often increase on a clear, calm night as a low cloud moves overhead?\n",
    "4. [2pts] Low clouds that touch the ground (fog) often fill the valleys below Pikes Peak. This is especially common during the morning and the winter. Why? To answer this question, draw on your knowledge of atmospheric thermodynamics, including air temperature, air density, evaporation/condensation, and saturation.\n",
    "5. [1pt] Why does the valley fog typically dissipate by mid-day?\n",
    "6. [2pts] We will not do formal trend analysis in this lab, but qualitatively what are the general long-term trends that you observe in the annual time series for each climate variable?\n",
    "7. [2pts] Under higher IPCC emissions scenarios, average annual global temperatures could increase by 2.9°C (5.2 °F) by 2100 relative to today (the Earth has already experienced around ~1.1°C of warming compared to preindustrial levels). How would an additional 2.9°C of warming locally impact water resources in the Rocky Mountain region. There are many ways to answer this question and receive full credit – consistency of thought is what is important.  \n",
